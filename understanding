            <h1>UNDERSTANDING THE SIGNS OF CYBER ROBBERY</h1>
            <p>Cyber robbery can manifest in various ways. Recognizing the signs early can help prevent losses. Here are some key indicators:</p>
          </div>
            
          <div class="signs">
              <ol>
                  <li><strong>Unusual Account Activity:</strong> One of the first signs that cyber criminals may be after you is unusual activity in your online accounts. This can include unfamiliar login locations, password change notifications, or unauthorized transactions. Regularly monitoring your accounts and setting up alerts for suspicious activity can help you catch these early warning signs..</li>
                  <li><strong>Phishing Emails:</strong> Phishing attempts are a common tactic used by cybercriminals to steal personal information. Be wary of emails or messages that contain urgent requests, unfamiliar links, or attachments. These communications often appear from legitimate sources but aim to trick you into revealing sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.</li>
                  <li><strong>Account Lockouts:</strong> Inability to access accounts due to password changes you didn’t make.</li>
                  <li><strong>Suspicious Links:</strong> Links in messages that lead to unfamiliar sites.</li>
                  <li><strong>Unexpected Notifications:</strong> Alerts about changes to your account settings or security questions.</li>
                  <li><strong>Unexpected Software Installations: </strong>If you notice software you didn’t install on your device, it could be a sign that a cybercriminal has gained access. Malware and spyware can be installed without your knowledge and are used to track your activity or steal information. Regularly check your installed programs and apps, and remove anything unfamiliar.</li>
                  <li><strong>Sluggish Device Performance:</strong> A sudden slowdown in your device’s performance can indicate that it has been compromised. Malware running in the background can consume significant resources, leading to slower operations. If your device becomes unusually slow, it’s worth investigating further to ensure it hasn’t been infected.</li>
                  <li><strong>Frequent Pop-ups and Ads: 
                  </strong>An increase in pop-ups and ads, especially those that appear even when you’re not browsing the internet, can be a sign of adware or malware. These intrusive advertisements can redirect you to malicious websites that steal your information. Using a reliable ad blocker and running regular scans can help mitigate this risk.</li>
              
                  <li><strong>Unexplained Data Usage: </strong>A spike in data usage on your internet plan can indicate that a cybercriminal is using your network. This can happen if malware on your device communicates with a remote server or someone has gained unauthorized access to your Wi-Fi. Regularly monitoring your data usage can help you spot these anomalies.</li>
                  <li><strong>Ransomware Messages: </strong>Ransomware locks you from your device or files until you pay a ransom. If you receive messages demanding payment to regain access, it’s a clear sign that a cybercriminal has targeted you. Avoid paying the ransom and seek professional help to remove the malware and restore your data.</li>
