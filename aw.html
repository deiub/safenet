        Nine people were arrested in General Trias, Cavite on Wednesday
        evening for their alleged involvement in a voice phishing scam. “Ang
        mga arestado ay parte ng isang malaking sindikato at may mataas pa
        dito at yun ay patuloy na hahanapin natin,” Philippine National Police
        Anti-Cybercrime Group acting director Police Brigadier General Ronnie
        Cariaga said in Jun Veneracion’s report on “24 Oras” on Thursday.
        (Those who were arrested were part of a big syndicate and there is
        still someone bigger than them, whom we are still looking for.) In the
        scam, the perpetrators call their intended victims pretending to be
        bank personnel, and tell them that they can convert their credit card
        points into cash. They ask the victims to give them the one-time PIN
        provided by the banks, then use the PIN to clean out the victim's bank
        account.

     <p class="news-description">
        The number of complaints for cybercrimes has decreased by 35% this
        year so far compared to the record in 2023, according to the
        Philippine National Police (PNP). advertisement "Sa first semester po
        ng 2024, from January to June 27, ay nakita po natin na bumababa naman
        po 'yung mga kaso ng cyber-related crimes. In fact, from January 1 to
        [June] 27, 2024, there was a 34.99% decrease," PNP spokesperson Police
        Colonel Jean Fajardo said in a press briefing on Tuesday, citing data
        from the Anti-Cybercrime Group (ACG). (In the first semester of 2024,
        from January to June 27, we saw that the cases of cyber-related crimes
        are decreasing. In fact, from January 1 to June 27, 2024, there was a
        34.99% decrease.) For the first quarter of 2024, the PNP earlier
        reported a 21.84% increase in cybercrime complaints compared to the
        record for the same period in 2023. Despite the improvement, Fajardo
        still advised the public to be vigilant on cybercrimes.

        Be on the lookout for a new wave of text scams, the Cybercrime
        Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC) warned. In Chino Gaston’s
        report on 24 Oras on Thursday, the CICC said a syndicate or syndicates
        may be behind the scams, which include "warnings" that your card is
        being used, or fake messages from the MMDA. In one scam, the text
        message contains a link and once it is clicked, the syndicate may
        acquire the victim’s name, bank or credit card number account number,
        and other personal details. "A-advise-an ka since you did not make
        these purchases, I will send you a code and you send this code to this
        cellphone number. Doon ka mahuhuli 'yung cellphone na 'yung
        unregistered and yet it is receiving data. If you have the number of
        your account manager, tawag niyo agad before talking to strangers,"
        CICC executive director Alexander Ramos said. (The text message will
        advise you that since you did not make any purchases, it will send you
        a code and you will forward it to another number. That is when we know
        that the number is unregistered. Call your account manager before
        talking to strangers.)
